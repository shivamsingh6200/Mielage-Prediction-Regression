# Mielage-Prediction-Regression-Analysis

In this Mileage Prediction project, I'm utilizing a dataset sourced from Stalibb that includes key automotive features, namely cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year.

1.Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the engine. Generally, more cylinders might indicate a larger and more powerful engine, but it could also impact fuel efficiency.

2.Displacement: The total volume of all the cylinders in an engine. Larger displacements usually indicate larger, more powerful engines, but they may be less fuel-efficient.

3.Horsepower: The power produced by the engine. Higher horsepower often means better performance, but it can also impact fuel consumption.

4.Weight: The weight of the vehicle. Heavier vehicles tend to have lower fuel efficiency.

5.Acceleration: The time it takes for a vehicle to go from 0 to 60 mph. Faster acceleration may suggest higher performance, but it can also influence fuel consumption.

6.Model Year: The year the vehicle was manufactured. Newer models might incorporate more fuel-efficient technologies.

These variables serve as the independent factors in my regression analysis, aiming to predict the dependent variable, which is the mileage (fuel efficiency) of vehicles. The number of cylinders and engine displacement provide insights into the engine's size and capacity, while horsepower reflects the engine's power. Weight is a crucial factor as heavier vehicles often exhibit lower fuel efficiency. Acceleration, representing the time it takes for a vehicle to accelerate, can influence both performance and fuel consumption. Additionally, the model year is considered, acknowledging that newer models may incorporate advancements in technology leading to improved fuel efficiency. By employing regression analysis on these features, my project seeks to uncover the nuanced relationships between these variables and mileage, ultimately contributing to the development of an accurate and insightful predictive model for fuel efficiency.
